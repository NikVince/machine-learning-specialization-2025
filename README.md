## 📚 Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a **backup and version control system** for my Jupyter notebooks, lab exercises, and graded assignments from the [Machine Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/lecture/lwqzq/jupyter-notebooks) course on Coursera, taught by Andrew Ng and the DeepLearning.AI team.

### 🎯 Main Objectives
- **Backup**: Safely store all course work and progress
- **Version Control**: Track changes and improvements over time
- **Portfolio**: Document learning journey and practical implementations
- **Reference**: Maintain organized collection of ML concepts and code

## 📖 Course Content

The Machine Learning Specialization consists of 3 courses:

### 1. Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification
- **Week 1**: Linear regression fundamentals
- **Week 2**: Logistic regression and classification
- **Week 3**: Advanced classification techniques

### 2. Advanced Learning Algorithms  
- **Week 1**: Neural networks and deep learning
- **Week 2**: TensorFlow implementation and ReLU activations
- **Week 3**: Advanced neural network concepts

### 3. Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
- Clustering algorithms
- Dimensionality reduction
- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement learning fundamentals

## 🚀 Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ 
- pip (Python package installer)
- Git for version control

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd machine-learning-specialization-2025

# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv ml_env

# Activate virtual environment
source ml_env/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
# or
ml_env\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🛠️ Working with the Repository

### Daily Workflow
1. **Activate Environment**: `source ml_env/bin/activate`
2. **Start Jupyter**: `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab`
3. **Complete Labs**: Work through course exercises
4. **Save Progress**: Commit your work regularly
5. **Push Changes**: Keep remote repository updated

### Jupyter Commands
```bash
# Start Jupyter Notebook (classic interface)
jupyter notebook

# Start Jupyter Lab (modern interface)
jupyter lab

# Deactivate environment when done
deactivate
```

## 📦 Key Dependencies

- **Core ML**: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib
- **Jupyter**: jupyter, notebook, ipykernel
- **Visualization**: seaborn, plotly
- **Deep Learning**: tensorflow, keras (for advanced topics)

## 🎯 Benefits of This Setup

✅ **Version Control**: Track your progress and commit your work  
✅ **Offline Work**: Learn without internet dependency  
✅ **Custom Packages**: Install any additional libraries you need  
✅ **Performance**: Local execution is typically faster  
✅ **Git Streak**: Perfect for maintaining daily commit habits  
✅ **Backup Security**: Multiple copies of your work  
✅ **Portfolio Building**: Document your ML learning journey  

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"externally-managed-environment" error**: Always use the virtual environment, not system Python.

**Package not found**: Ensure your virtual environment is activated (you should see `(ml_env)` in your terminal).

**Jupyter not starting**: Verify you're in the virtual environment and all packages are installed.

### Getting Help
- Check that your virtual environment is activated
- Verify packages: `pip list`
- Reinstall if needed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
